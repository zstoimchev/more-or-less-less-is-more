# More or Less - Less is More

&emsp;More or less - less is more, is a button game, developed in Java. The goal od the game is to reach the target value, by pressing random buttons each time. Random combination of numbers and buttons appear every time the game is started.

&emsp;The game starts, such that the user presses one button (button a), whichever he wants. Then, he is able to press only the buttons in the same row and column (all the other buttons are disabled). When pressing the next button (button b), the value of the previouslu pressed button (button a) changes, with the operation: <b>aRb%10</b>. The opperation (R) which is in use is shown on the right side of the panel.

&emsp;The user has limited number of moves. When the number of moves are equal to zero, the user loses the game. Otherwise, if the result is equal with the target value, the user wins the game. Whichever the case, the user is prompted with pop-up if he has lost or won the game.

&emsp;In the menu, there are options to select difficulty levels, as well to save and load the game (even though it is still now working right...)

&emsp;Random combination of numbers and buttons appear every time the game is started.
Good luck winning! :)
